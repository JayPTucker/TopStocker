**Updated (6/28/21):**
Top Stocker is a Full-Stack Web Application that allows Business owners to keep proper track of the stock they have in their store.  However, this isn't necessarily meant for the stock that is on the shelves, but instead it's keeping track of the extra stock they have in the back, or at the top shelf, hence the name, "Top Stocker".  Top Stocker was actually based off of Lowes Home Improvement and how they manage their top stock.  This was made in order for the Top Stock to be easily kept track of using Amazon's Databases.

## 💻 Usage: <a name='usage'></a> 
**Updated (6/28/21):**
When you first see the Website you'll notice the front page that is pretty self explanatory.  You have your "Search" section where you can search for items based off of their item numbers.  Then, you have your "Add an Item" section, where you're able to add an item based on the data that you have collected on it. (As of 6/28 the available boxes that you enter your data in, are mainly based off of how Lowes inventory works).  Once you add an item, it should appear below in the list of items Available.  Also, any items you search for will be found in the "History" tab located in the Navigation Bar thanks to Local Storage.
